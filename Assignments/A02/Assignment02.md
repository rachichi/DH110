# Assignment 2: Usability Evaluation with Users

Rachel Liu | DH-110 | Fall 2022

### Introduction: sustainability@BU Mobile App
Building sustainable communities takes a little effort from a lot of people, and downloadable resources may be the first step in achieving this goal. The current college-aged generation are avid smartphone users and developing an app that is mutually beneficial for the individual and the impacted world around them can make all the difference in our journey towards sustainability. In this assignment, I call out three issues contributing to a negative user experience within the sustainability@BU App, an application created for use by Boston University students. The goal of the app is the make students' daily habits more sustainable, and creates a community in which students can post images of themselves taking part in the sustainability movement, while gaining points and awards to compete with friends. The most significant issues found within the app during my initial heuristic evaluations are listed below. Tasks within the usability test will aim to dig deeper into the root causes of each.

##### 1. Absence of System Status Visibility
When users first enter into the app, the structure of the program is unclear. Besides the home page, each individual section has no visible tie back to the previous page. Developers should instead create a more effective menu bar by optimizing use of icons, decreasing menu size, and apply it to all pages possible so users are always aware of their location in the application.
##### 2. No Match Between System and the Real World
Users are bombarded with a massive overload of novel metrics and vocabulary when they first log in. Points, Buzzes, Actions, Badges, and Medals are just a few examples. For sake of learnability, developers should decrease the amount of jargon such as establishing one obvious point system to track progress. For example, Khan Academy (energy points) and Reddit (Reddit karma) are websites and web apps which have found success in using a single point system.
##### 3. Error Prevention
If users accidentally posted a “Buzz” which acts a bit like a tweet, two main issues become evident, which are issues with findability and usability. Even after dedicating quite a bit of time to find the public tweet (as it did not show up in the “Trending” page), there exists no delete function once tweeted. What if a user had mistakenly written something offensive? Though icons are relatively large and difficult to accidentally click, there may be actions users have immediately regretted and would like to reverse.

### Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of this usability test is two fold. First, it serves as a validation exercise to confirm usability issues regarding system status visibility, information overload, and error prevention. Second, it allows researchers to understand underlying mechanisms for why these issues may exist and how one might address them. The following usability test is composed of three separate tasks. 

      1. Join a community

Suppose you would like to join and engage with a community to learn more about certain sustainable actions you can take to feel better about your contributions to the environment. 
* Create a profile to log in.
* Navigate to the trending page and scroll down until you see Mika Yao’s post about eating leftovers and give the original poster a like, comment, and follow. 
* Follow the 3 additional users that commented on that post.
* Join the challenge for this month.
      
      2. Raise your numbers: Your school just announced a prize for the top 5 performers on the October 2022 EcoChallenge. You want to rack up your numbers to increase your chance at winning this prize.

Suppose your school just announced a prize for the top 5 performers on the October 2022 EcoChallenge. You want to rack up your numbers to increase your chance at winning this prize.
* Gain 14 points, 5 buzzes, and 1 action by completing the “Bin to Win” category. Include a comment and photo as well. 
* Gain 1 additional point for the “badge” category by completing the “First Badge” achievement.
* Gain 1 additional point for the “medal” category. It is up to you what medal to achieve.
* Navigate to your profile tab to confirm the points have been added to your account.
      
      3. Reverse your actions: You’d like to clean up your profile and reset it back to the default. You delete comments from your post, comments from items in your feed, and remove yourself from the challenge.
Suppose you’d like to clean up your profile and reset it back to the default. You delete comments from your post, comments from items in your feed, and remove yourself from the challenge.
* Unfollow all the users that you followed in Task 1.
* Delete the comment and photo accommodating your post from Task 2. 
* Leave the challenge that you joined in Task 2.

### Usability Testing Methodology
The pilot usability testing took place in my apartment in Los Angeles, California. My participant used a laptop to complete the usability testing survey and her iPhone to complete the tasks within the sustabilability@BU mobile app. The survey taken on the laptop was composed of a pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, and a final post-test questionnaire. The Zoom recording video listed below captures the facial expressions and user journey of my participant while she used the sustainability@BU Mobile App.

### Reflection

#### Part 1: Findings
Findings that came out of this usability test can be categorized into the expected issues outlined in the above “Introduction” section.
##### 1. Absence of System Status Visibility
When the pilot user first entered the app she felt each icon within the navigation bar down at the bottom of  the screen represented the page content relatively well. Unfortunately, though the icons were intuitive, there was no obvious landing page and she wasn’t sure what tab to go to first. She was able to guess which page each task would be located even without prior knowledge. 
##### 2. No Match Between System and the Real World
This issue was most directly associated with Task 2, where the pilot user was asked to rack up points to win the challenge for this month. Though the majority of icons were intuitive, the “buzz” concept was confusing. The largest icon within the navigation bar was supposed to represent a “buzz,” but at first glance it looks like the function is to <i>add</i> something to the app, rather than <i>complete</i> an action. Once entered into the correct section, though, completing the initial part of the task was simple. 
The greatest drawback lay in the logistics of obtaining medals and badges. My pilot user faced three main issues: 1) did not understand the difference between these two, 2) was not able to find any instructions to guide them to obtaining either a badge or a medal, and 3) the descriptions on the badge when clicked on from another individual’s profile also failed to provide sufficient information. 
##### 3. Error Prevention
After testing, I discovered that the functionality available to my pilot user worked just fine – the issue was in the functionality that did not yet exist. Reversing actions and deleting comments were relatively easy once users figured out that you could long-press a comment to remove it. Visibly, there was no option to delete so that was a bit odd. 
Another issue occurred during my pilot user’s attempt to post a second “buzz” to the same category. Only after she typed out a caption, took a photo, and pressed post, did the app notify her that this was not possible and that she had maxed out on the category. This led to frustration and confusion.
Yet, the largest issue was the inability to delete an action or at least make it private. My pilot user voiced her embarrassment to see her name had been one of the few posts that popped up within the challenge with low activity. She would have preferred either the option to delete her post or privatize it; neither of which are functionalities currently available within the app. 

#### Part 2: Overall Thoughts
Although I have previously conducted interviews within internships and educational settings, these were typically generative research done early in the creation of a product or program. This project was my first experience conducting a usability study. There are two main categories of learnings from the pilot usability test: what went smoothly and what was unexpected. Firstly, I’ve noticed that the smoothest portions of the usability test were the portions in which a script was involved. Having enough preparation beforehand made it easy to guide users through the tasks. The unexpected ended up being quite lengthy. I believed that logistics, such as recording phone screens, facial expressions, and recording tasks, would go the easiest. What I realized too late was that it is nearly impossible to see whether a recording went perfectly until after it is complete. Half of the zoom recording did not include my pilot user’s facial expressions due to glitches in the software. Next time I will be sure to have separate cameras to capture facial expressions and app testing. Time management was also difficult; knowing when to allow users to give up on tasks and when to push them to continue. Within one specific section, I chose a task that I could not even complete during my initial research into the application. In future studies, I will run tasks by researchers who are more expert in the field to understand whether seemingly impossible items should be removed from the task list.
