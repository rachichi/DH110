# Assignment 4: UX Storytelling

Rachel Liu | DH-110 | Fall 2022

## 📖 The Purpose of UX Storytelling
Much of the success of building a sustainable community comes from the basic foundation of helping our youth develop sustainable habits, one step at a time. In order to do this, app developers must see the world from the users’ perspective, which in this case would be undergraduate students at UCLA. Although operating collectively as one student body, the individuals that make up this community differ drastically in their needs, wants, and user journeys. This assignment on UX Storytelling aims to identify these differences in the form of easy-to-understand stories so that the app can be tailored to best fit their needs.

## 🗺 Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Anabella's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Anabella is using this product
> Anabella lays on the floor of her classic triple as she mindlessly cycles through the seemingly endless social media applications in her phone. It’s her first quarter at UCLA, and to be completely honest, she’s not doing too great. It is her first time ever away from home; the first time ever she’s had to leave friends and family behind. She was so pumped to finally have a cool new group of friends outside her small town bubble back home. But, it turns out, making new friends is not the easiest. And to top it all off, she was rejected from her dream sorority. To her, it really couldn’t get any worse. She looks around the room to check it is empty before she lets out a dramatic, miserable sign. She chuckles. Of course it’s empty. Though her roommates meant well, Anabella couldn’t help but feel a tinge of jealousy. Within the first couple weeks, both her roommates had already found their “group,” and got into their dream sororities. They’re never home. For the millionth time, Anabella wishes that she could just fly home and feel the warm fuzzies of her mother’s embrace

#### How Anabella is using this product
> Just then, she hears running footsteps, the urgent jingling of keys, and her roommate bursts through the door. “You’re not busy right?” She asks, out of breath. “Wanna join this sustainability challenge with me? Promise it’ll be fun,” she urges. Anabella, of course, is very obviously not busy, and so she reluctantly follows her roommate’s instructions to download Sustainiversity, an app where UCLA students can earn points from participating in frequent sustainability challenges. After downloading the app, she logs in through SSO, automatically rerouting her to the official UCLA version of the app. She is prompted to build a profile, where she enjoys the process of adding her name, choosing a flattering profile photo, typing out a witty bio, and toggling the profile privacy button to “Public”. After clicking “Save,” she is routed to an explore page. Before she can scroll through the collection of silly images posted by familiar faces she had recognized from walking down BruinWalk, a popup quickly notifies her that the “Residence Hall Challenge is happening now!” with options below to “Close” or  “Join Now.” She clicks “Join Now.” A simple checklist of sustainable actions appears, all of which can be completed within and around the dorm building. While Anabella and her roommate run back and forth along the hallways to check leaking faucets and shower heads in the communal bathroom, turn off unnecessary lights, and recycle the pizza boxes they got at Epicuria, they convince more and more curious freshmen to join in on the effort. By the time the challenge is complete, Anabella is teeming with excitement. She feels closer to not only her roommate, but also to the other residents on the floor. In fact, this newfound group is already planning on participating in another sustainability challenge next week together, which is to go picnicking on campus with reusable containers.

### 2. Ahmed's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Ahmed is using this product
> For the third time this week, Ahmed is working overtime for his environmental law firm. He doesn’t mind (it’s good pay), except for the fact that his partner is fuming at him for running late to their date – again. His recent decision to take on more hours at his internship was based on two reasons. First is that he simply doesn’t feel the same excitement for UCLA as he did freshman and sophomore year – although that might be due to the pandemic. Second is that he wants to feel like making some kind of impact on the Earth he calls home. All his environmental classes has stressed him out about the ticking time bomb of irriversable climate change. Recently, Ahmed has been thinking that contributing to sustainability efforts through environmental law is a bit of an investment before he can actually make a difference, and wants to begin developing habits to feel an immediate contribution. Unfortunately, he feels overwhelmed by the amount of work on his plate and simply does not have the time to create his own action plan to accomplish this goal

#### How Ahmed is using this product
> As Ahmed hurries down BruinWalk, preoccupied by his favorite podcast, “The Science Hour,” he almost stumbles into a bulletin board. Before he continues on his journey (he was already late to class), a bright green flier catches his eye. “Download Sustainiversity!” it says, “You can help reverse climate change, one step at a time.” Ahmed scoffed. It sounded too good to be true. But, he takes out his phone to scan the QR code before heading to class. 

That night, after another long day at work, he decides to take a peek around the app. Turns out Sustainiversity is an app where UCLA students can earn points from following personalized action plans. After downloading the app, he logs in through SSO, automatically rerouting him to the official UCLA version of the app. He speeds through the “Build Your Profile” section, only adding his first name before checking to make sure the profile privacy button was toggled to “Private”. After clicking “Save,” he is routed to an explore page. A popup quickly notifies him that the “Residence Hall Challenge is happening now!” with options below to “Close” or  “Join Now.” He clicks “Close” and checks the box below saying “Do not notify me of this again.” Ahmed couldn’t care less about these on campus events.

He clicks out of the explore page using the navigation bar towards the bottom of the screen and presses on the planning icon. The app prompts him to choose at least [three sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) he is interested in acting upon. Once chosen, he is asked to click one of three additional options: Dedicate 5 minutes/day, 10 minutes/week or 1 hour/month. He chooses 5 minutes/day because he wants to build a daily habit. Immediately, he is presented with a list of easy-to-read and easy-to-do activities that he can do in 5 minutes or less. Over the course of the week, Ahmed diligently dedicates his 5 minutes a day to fixing leaky faucets, scrapping the freezer, or unplugging electronics before his weekend getaways with his partner. It’s easy to fit into his busy schedule because the app notifies him of this daily task every day when he is at home. Ahmed feels accomplished for not only contributing to a sustainable community, but also for being able to consistently deliver on this habit.

## Reflection
Creating personas is one of my favorite parts of the UX process, although only when it is based off of concrete, empirical data. Much of this process was putting myself in the shoes of someone that I *think*, based solely on persona experience, would exist within the contraints of our target audience. However, creating user stories, empathy maps, and journey maps was definitely a fun, creative experience which I expect I will implement in my current internship soon.
In the future, with more time, I will improve upon two major aspects of this assignment. First is to conduct user interviews and create user personas based on empirical data. Second, these personas would be created with much stronger personalities with stricter motivations, goals, and challenges. Therefore, the projects that follow would have a much more defined directionality.
