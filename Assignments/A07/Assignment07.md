# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype

Rachel Liu | DH-110 | Fall 2022

## Description of project 

This project plays on a hypothetical situation in which the social media company, BeReal, attempts to help college students build a better community for the future. Previously, this was done by generating a non-addictive, "Real" online experience. Now, within this hypothetical project, BeReal has created a "Sustainiversity Mode," in collaboration with the UN Department of Sustainable Development in which users can complete exciting sustainability-themed Daily Challenges to share with friends and/or other peers within their university. Creating high fidelity prototypes are crucial to the visual and animation refining process which will be further judged during usability testing and cognitive walkthroughs. Feedback from these testing sessions will culminate in one final protoype which will eventually be passed onto software developers. 
There are 7 total tasks that can be completed by the user:
1. Complete the Daily Challenge from the Home Page.
2. Complete the Daily Challenge from the notification on your lock screen. 
3. View posts from your peers at UCLA.
4. View today’s completed the challenge in full screen. 
5. Learn more about BeReal’s mission. 
6. Find the number of gallons of water you’ve saved in total.
7. Find the amount of CO2 you’ve saved from completing this challenge.

### Feedback and Solutions from Iteration 1 Usability Testing
| Number | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Header text is blocked by mobile constraints at the top of the page.  | All header components were moved 41 pixels down so that it would be visible below the mobile constraints. |
| 2 | It would be equally realistic to complete the Daily Challenge from the notification in the lock screen | Another frame was added to the prototype linking the Daily Challenge from the lock screen notification. |
| 3 | Provide a direct link to the Impact Number from Daily Challenge to showcase incremental changes. | Popup was added immediately after uploading completed Daily Challenge asking if users wanted to be directed to Impact Number. |
| 4 | Buttons pointing to the right and left should move in that direction intuitively. | Animations were updated to reflect button directions. |
| 5 | Users should receive a message that they cannot post again that day after completing the Daily Challenge. | A popup was added as an overlay to notify users they are unable to post again after completing the Daily Challenge. |
| 6 | There should be a navigation bar in the “Learn More” area. All headers and navigation bars should be locked while scrolling. The scrollable content should be fully visible even with the navigation bar at the bottom. | A navigation bar was added to relevant areas. Headers and navigation bars were locked. Scrollable content components were updated to be visible above the navigation bar. |
