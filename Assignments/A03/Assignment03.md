# Assignment 2: Usability Evaluation with Users

## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Steps 1 & 2: Specify the main design challenge & identify target users

The road to sustainability begins with our youth – more specifically, undergraduate students. This target audience has the optimal combination of traits to build the future we need. They are equipped with three main characteristics: the autonomy to make decisions, the excitement to join a community, and the capacity to influence others. The research goal for this assignment is as follows: How might we motivate undergraduate students at UCLA to build sustainable habits? 
In order to make the largest impact, it is important to capitalize on the basic student need of “belonging and love”. Traditional solutions include popular social media such as Snapchat, Instagram, or BeReal. Applying this knowledge to the current project, it is crucial to improve current usability limitations of the app by creating a digital environment that feels mainstream, familiar, and social, similar to the popular social media listed previously. Limitations that possibly would be improved would be the clunkiness, unfamiliarity, and aesthetics of the application.
The hope is that users will see the app as home to one main activity, a place to interact with their campus community, and to fulfill the need of “belonging and love.” The main activity can be broken down into two smaller components, as any successful interaction requires both an input and an output. The input is students posting silly pictures of small sustainable accomplishments to the feed, and the output is gaining points to earn tangible prizes. The activity can be done anywhere, but would typically occur immediately after completing a sustainable action. Once a user realizes that they have completed a digital goal in real life, they would snap a picture of their completed action, add a witty caption, and share it to followers in their community. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

I decided to employ two types of research methods, each with a distinct goal: **Analogous Inspiration** and **Participatory Interaction**. Analogous Inspiration involved watching as undergraduate friends navigated through popular social media applications which serve as a parallel situation for how the application might operate. Participatory Interaction, on the other hand, focuses on increasing understanding of habit building within college students and determining pain points to explain why it might be difficult to develop sustainable habits within university.

## Reflection & Findings

I learned quite a bit from conducting these two research studies. What I found the most surprising was the difficulty in which it took to narrow down my scope. And even so, once the target audience has been determined and the research question established, the numbers of potential methods in which to approach that question were overwhelming. Therefore, I settled on two methods with distinct goals. 
With Analogous Inspiration, findings were surprisingly easy to correlate to other activites. See below for a list of findings:
* Clicking into social media applications was typically initiated by a notification on the lock screen. When that notification involved a message, rather than a like or comment, the proportion of pick-up relative to the notification was almost 1:1. 
* There was a direct positive correlation between the number of potential functions on the app and time spent on the platform, with Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok being the most time consuming, and BeReal and Snapchat being the least.
* Similarly, there was a negative correlation between the number of potential functions on the app and movement in the real world when using the platform. Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok were typically being used while stationary, while BeReal and Snapchat were being used regardless of movement. 
* When users enter an application without a premeditated task, it takes them much longer to exit the app.
* There are three types of social media archetypes present in the undergraduate community, supporting previous insights developed by [CocaCola Research Center](https://www.ccrrc.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2014/02/Untangling-the-Social-Web_Part-31.pdf). First, there is the Bonder, who enjoys social media as a platform to “pass the time” and maintain connections with family, friends and colleagues. Second is the Sharer, who feels useful when retweeting or reposting items created by others. Finally, there is the Creator, who treats social media as an opportunity to showcase skills and talent in the form of art or activism.

Although facinating, collecting these findings without my friends' knowledge felt like a privacy breach. It was a tricky expedition to covertly observe my friends’ phone usage because it is considered “nosy” to look over peoples’ shoulders while they are on their phone. Due to this challenge, the represented audience came strictly from my extremely close group of friends who would not mind this seemingly newfound interest in their phone activity. Next time, I might come up with more creative ways to gather this type of information – possibly asking for screen time screenshots and asking follow up questions to determine root causes behind app usage. 

With Participatory Observation, I felt more at home, as this is closer to traditional generative research. I found narrowing my research question to focus on UCLA students was a great option because it allowed to me to understand the importance of college-specific external factors. My research participant emphasized the need to run changes in habits by her roommates so they could hold each other accountable with efforts toward sustainbaility. In the future it is crucial to interview more people across different demographics. For example, students living in dorms have a very different experience in building sustainable habits compared to students living in apartments. In addition, I am interested in trends between students and how the app can be optimized to deliver these various personas, which can only be generated after at least 5 interviews.
