      <p>BeReal. Sustainiversity mode is a hypothetical project where students from DH 110 were asked to complete a design challenge centered around sustainability. After being provided with an initial prompt, I decided to further limit the scope by focusing on building sustainable communities. The target audience was chosen to be UCLA students because educating and engaging our youth is the first step to reach this goal, one small habit at a time. Eventually, the research question was created: <b>How might we motivate undergraduate students at UCLA to build sustainable habits?”</b> The answer lay in the ensuing research conducted below.</p>

        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Building sustainable communities is arguably one of the most important initiatives to ensure our future success. Unfortunately, the path to sustainability is shrouded in mystery and blocked by seemingly unattainable goals. If we truly want to value sustainability, we must begin by educating and engaging our youth, one small habit at a time. This mobile application will not only equip the next generation of city-builders with exciting tidbits of knowledge on how to build a sustainable city but will generate a community of like-minded people as well.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">1. Heuristic Analysis</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Step 1 was to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation of existing sites and mobile applications to gauge potential competitors and identify knowledge and usability gaps to optimize the redesign. 10 Usability Heuristics were used to guide this evaluation for two different mobile apps: Earth Rewards and Sustainability. Each usability heuristic was briefly analyzed and a recommendation was provided for both applications. Click the link below to learn more.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Step 2 was a Usability Evaluation. In this section, I call out three issues contributing to a negative user experience within the sustainability@BU App, an application created for use by Boston University students. Each of the three issues identified were attributed to a specific task which was used to conduct a usability test. These tasks served to dig deeper into the root causes of each issue and aimed to identify exactly what could be improved to alleviate the user experience. Click the link below to learn more.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Step 3 was a contextual inquiry exercise. To improve current usability limitations of the app by creating a digital environment that feels mainstream, familiar, and social, I decided to employ two types of research methods, each with a distinct goal: Analogous Inspiration and Participatory Interaction. Analogous Inspiration involved watching as undergraduate friends navigated through popular social media applications which serve as a parallel situation for how the application might operate. Participatory Interaction, on the other hand, focuses on increasing understanding of habit building within college students and determining pain points to explain why it might be difficult to develop sustainable habits within university.

          <h5 class="card-title">4. UX Storytelling</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Step 4 was UX storytelling. Much of the success of building a sustainable community comes from the basic foundation of helping our youth develop sustainable habits, one step at a time. In order to do this, app developers must see the world from the users’ perspective, which in this case would be undergraduate students at UCLA. Although operating collectively as one student body, the individuals that make up this community differ drastically in their needs, wants, and user journeys. This assignment aims to identify these differences in the form of easy-to-understand stories so that the app can be tailored to best fit their needs. Click the link below to learn more.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Step 5 was generating a low-fidelity prototype. User research demonstrated a functional divide between web page and mobile app usage, and validated the need for a mobile app to serve the target audience. The designed interactions are crucial representations of what users expect, want, and need to happen in response to clicking on certain icons. The mindset of the target audience, regardless of how contrasting it might be from the researcher, must be taken into consideration to successfully create an experience that feels intuitive to those who will use the application. Within this project, three main tasks were asked of the participants, which can be further explored by clicking on the link below.</p>

To address the needs of the two personas described in previous assignments, BeReal will add a “Sustainiversity” toggle in Settings which adds exciting features. This feature, once toggled on, would be called “BeReal. Sustainiversity Mode” The purpose of interface design is to take bare-bones wireframes and further develop them into prototypes through various typography, shape, color, and layout comparisons. These styles will culminate in a cohesive style guide which can be quickly applied to components in the final product.</p>

Within this hypothetical project, BeReal has created a "Sustainiversity Mode," in collaboration with the UN Department of Sustainable Development in which users can complete exciting sustainability-themed Daily Challenges to share with friends and/or other peers within their university. Creating high fidelity prototypes are crucial to the visual and animation refining process which will be further judged during the cognitive walkthroughs conducted in class. Feedback from these testing sessions was realized in one final prototype which will eventually be passed onto software developers. There are 7 total tasks that can be completed by the user, which can be further explored by clicking on the link below.

        <h1 class="display-5">Concluding Remarks</h1>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>What I’ve enjoyed most from this design challenge for DH 110 were the practical applications I have already been able to apply towards my jobs on campus and externally within my post-grad position. I’ve learned more skills than I can count and have listed the most impactful ones below:</p>
        <p><b>Research Structure:</b> Though I must admit, this course was at times, quite exhausting, this is the farthest I have ever gotten in the research process with a design generated by my own creativity – and it feels amazing! Being introduced to a formalized research process also helped to instill confidence in future projects, because I know that this system “works”. From empathizing with the user, to defining the problem space, brainstorming, and prototyping, I have been able to overcome challenges and develop solutions that I will continue to use in the future.</p>
        <p><b>Design Tools:</b> Speaking of uses for the future, the Figma demos I have learned have been extremely helpful in saving time and organizing content within low and high-fidelity prototypes. I would most likely not have discovered plugins such as the wireflow creator or the accessibility checker, and fully understood how to use components or other interactive features if it weren’t for the guidance from the professor and other peers. On the other hand, even building this page allowed me to learn basic CSS and HTML in Brackets and navigate through the awesome resource that is Bootstrap.</p>
        <p><b>Building for the User:</b> One of the most important soft skills I learned was the importance of empathy and building for the user. Though we only had a short amount of time for this design challenge, the majority of it was spent researching and building our product from this research. This is crucial to keep in mind for future projects, because new technology should only be built to fill a void or usability gap experienced by the user. Without understanding the user’s voice, the app will be rendered useless and crucial resources would have been unnecessarily wasted.</p>
        <p>Overall, this course has inspired me to continue building out my professional portfolio with projects that excite me. I look forward to employing skills and processes I learned within these past few weeks!</p>
