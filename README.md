# Building Sustainable Habits

## Rachel Liu | DH-110 UX+UI Design | Fall 2022

### Design Statement

Building sustainable communities is arguably one of the most important initiatives to ensure our future success. Unfortunately, the path to sustainability is shrouded in mystery and blocked by seemingly unattainable goals. If we truly want to value sustainability, we must begin by educating and engaging our youth, one small habit at a time. This mobile application will not only equip the next generation of city-builders with exciting tidbits of knowledge on how to build a sustainable city but will generate a community of like-minded people as well. 

### Research

The first step was to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation of existing sites and mobile apps to gauge potential competitor sites and identify knowledge gaps to optimize. See more within my [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/rachichi/DH110-22F/blob/main/Assignments/A01/Assignment01.md).
