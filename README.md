# Building Sustainable Habits

## Rachel Liu | DH-110 UX+UI Design | Fall 2022

### Design Statement

Building sustainable communities is arguably one of the most important initiatives to ensure our future success. Unfortunately, the path to sustainability is shrouded in mystery and blocked by seemingly unattainable goals. If we truly want to value sustainability, we must begin by educating and engaging our youth, one small habit at a time. This mobile application will not only equip the next generation of city-builders with exciting tidbits of knowledge on how to build a sustainable city but will generate a community of like-minded people as well. 

### Research

Step one was to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation of existing sties and mobile applications to gauge potential competitors and identify knowledge and usability gaps to optimize.

The second step was a Usability Evaluation. In this section, I call out three issues contributing to a negative user experience within the sustainability@BU App, an application created for use by Boston University students. The goal of the app is the make students' daily habits more sustainable, and creates a community in which students can post images of themselves taking part in the sustainability movement. Tasks within the usability test dug deeper into the root causes of each. Read more within my [usability evaluation](https://github.com/rachichi/DH110-22F/blob/main/Assignments/A02/Assignment02.md).
