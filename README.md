## About the project

Building sustainable communities is arguably one of the most important initiatives to ensure our future success. Unfortunately, the path to sustainability is shrouded in mystery and blocked by seemingly unattainable goals. If we truly want to value sustainability, we must begin by educating and engaging our youth. This project aims to make sustainable living accessible by creating a space where students can compete against others in exciting challenges for coveted prizes. This mobile application will not only equip the next generation of city-builders with knowledge on how to build a sustainable city but will generate a community of like-minded people as well.
